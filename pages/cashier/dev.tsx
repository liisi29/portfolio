        All the processes have changed back and forth several times during the
        years.

        There have been times when I get the complete analytics for my code
        almost down to method names (well.. almost)
      </p>
      <p>
        But most of the time I got the requirements from project manager and we
        talked it over with the backend guys what I need in and what they can
        send by api in order to do the feature..
